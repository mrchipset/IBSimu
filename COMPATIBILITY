		INCOMPATIBLE LIBRARY CHANGES
		============================

This document describes those library changes that break end-user
programs, that is removal or changes of old features or
functions. This list was started from version 1.0.3.

IBSimu 1.0.4dev
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

VectorField is made abstract and efields inherits vector field. Mesh
base vector field is now MeshVectorField. Potential based electric
field is still EpotEfield.

All MyDXFEntities constructors need a pointer to MyDXFFile. This
change is made to give MyDXFEntities access to warning level setting
at MyDXFFile.

All debug_print() commands now require a reference to the output
stream where debugging information is printed to.

ParticleDataBase::set_thread_count() is deprecated by introducing
global setting for thread count in IBSimu class. The set_thread_count
function still remains for compatibility reasons but has no effect.

Plasma suppression for magnetic fields enabled with particle database
member enable_nsimp_plasma_threshold() is replaced with new
set_bfield_suppression() using callback functors.

Error reporting classes are privatized. Printing now done with
print_error_message()

IBSimu 1.0.4							
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changed enum efield_extrpl_e to enum field_extrpl_e for making
extrapolations more general (also to be used with bfields).

IBSimu 1.0.3							
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Verbosity level is now controlled using IBSimu::set_verbose_output()
in global ibsimu class instead of the old globally defined integer
verbose_output. The header file verbose.hpp doesn't exist
anymore. IBSimu class is defined in ibsimu.h

Function set_nsimp_initial_plasma() to set initial plasma area has
changed. The functionality is changed to be fully three dimensional
and now the plasma area is defined using a function.
