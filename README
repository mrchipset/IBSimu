Introduction
------------

IBSimu is an ion optics simulation library with several capabilities
for solving electric fields in a geometry and tracing particles in 
electric and magnetic fields. The code currently has following features:

1. Finite Difference Method (FDM) for solving Poisson's equation 1D, 2D 
   and 3D spaces and in the special case of cylindrical symmetry (3D 
   problem reduced to 2D).
2. Particle trajectory calculation in the solved potential.
3. Space charge density calculation from the trajectories .
4. Vlasov iteration using features 1 to 3.



Installing
----------

Ion Beam Simulator is a library written in C++ and is compilable by
modern gcc compilers in linux/unix and Microsoft Windows
environments. If the dependencies are available and correctly
installed, it should be pretty straightforward to compile the library
using GNU autotools build system. See the file INSTALL for details or
the IBSimu website for more detailed description of installation.



Documentation
-------------

IBSimu is using Doxygen documentation system for building the
reference manual from documentation blocks included in the source
code. See directory doc/html and for built HTML documentation or do
'make doc' for generating the docs.

In the IBSimu website http://ibsimu.sourceforge.net/ there are also
installation instructions and a tutorial for first time users in html
format.


Acknowledgements
----------------

I would like to thank fellow workers at LBNL including S. K. Hahto,
J. H.  Vainionpää and J. Reijonen for fruitful discussions on
simulation codes and for giving me time and the possibility to develop
the code. Also I would like to thank J. H. Sarén for brainstorming the
C++ version of the code with me.
