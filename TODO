Randomize particle plotting

Make particle groups

New geometry collision detection routine (no need for solid inclusion
test after initial build)

Export for particle plotter
 - colormap and scatter

Tracking for field plotter
 - x1, x2, y1, y2 axes

Tracking for particle plotter
 - intensity with colormap plots

Q/M discrimination for plots (particle and geom) - two possibilities:
 - Create one more level to pdb for particle "groups"
 - Do the discrimination in plotter
 * Should have coloring and on/off selection for each group (preferences tab)

Particle plotter with points

UMFPACK gnewton
 - Better stability with high-intensity negative ion source simu

Particle iterator force delta s steplen
 - Problem with cylindrical coordinates -> seems to need adaptive steps

Particle beam definition
 - Possibility for ordered definition

Particle database save/load for making debugging

particlediagplot.cpp: scaling for profile plots in 2D

New space charge setting routine
 - Old routine is inaccurate with beams that are in E-fields

Add PIC style particle stepper

Suitesparse package to include umfpack.pc and amd.pc and newest
versions of the algorithms

Particle plot mirroring auto/off

Data export from geomplot window

Smooth edges for Gauss-Seidel solver

Colormap plots on eps/pdf canvas.

Optimize solvers (time using gperf)

Parallelize solvers

Improve CSG usability through input geometry definition script
